# Principles of Data Analytics

This repository contains my solutions for the **Principles of Data Analytics** module.

## 📜Introduction
Here you will find the content on the tasks developed during the semester of Principles of Data Analytics subject. 


## 📖 Notebook Structure
Each weekly task is organized by using markdowns, named according to the task,brief description and then the instruction for each task (e.g., `task 01: Source the Data Set`, `task 02: Explore the Data Structure`, ..., `task10`).

Within the markdown - Task number and title, you could find:

◽ Code cells in which the solutions to each task are executed.

◽ All relevant explanations and task details written as comments within the task itself.

This approach aims to help keep the notebook clean and focused on the task.


## 📑 About the Tasks
The tasks are designed to:

◽ Test the knowledge acquired in each lesson.

◽ Encourage independent problem-solving.

◽ Require external research to find and apply appropriate solutions.

◽ To be carried out during the semester, however improvements will be allowed until 04th May 2025.

## 💬 Comments & Documentation
All tasks are commented to:

◽ Explain the problem being solved.

◽ Describes the logic behind the code.

◽ Provide references and sources where necessary and applicable.


## 📚 Research & References
◽ Throughout the tasks, research and external resources have been cited.

◽ This information has been added to support learning and demonstrate my understanding.

◽ These references can be found in the code comments or in links from reliable sources, such as:
- Python Docs
- W3Schools

## 💻 Technologies 
◽ Python
◽ Git
◽ Github
◽ Jupyter
◽ Numpy
◽ Seaborn
